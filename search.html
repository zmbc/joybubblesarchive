He had always loved swimming pools, so he was in the habit of going to hotels just to use the pool all day. One weekend, he begins splashing and playing in the pool with a group of children. They play in the pool for practically the entire weekend, from the moment the pool opens until it closes each day.   He gets out of the pool on the last day, and he is approached by a woman named Ruth. Ruth tells him that she had come to the hotel with the intention of committing suicide following the death of her husband. But from her room she saw Joybubbles playing with the kids in the pool, and was so moved by it that she decided not to go through with the suicide, and choose life instead.",

        "description": "Joybubbles tells a story from when he was 6 years old and living in Berlin, New Jersey. His mother would take him with her to the grocery store, and he would wait outside in the car while she took \"20 years\" to shop. So in order to be less bored, he asks God to send Jesus or an angel down for him to talk to.   The very next day, a man comes into the car while Joybubbles is waiting, and begins to fiddle with the dashboard. Joybubbles, understanding the fascination with the dashboard, waits for a while before asking the man if he is Jesus. The man, surprised, says that he isn't, which Joybubbles takes to mean that he must be an angel. Joybubbles asks the man all sorts of questions about being an angel and living in heaven, before recommending to that the man go to church, because the priest there would probably want to meet an angel. Tearfully, the man leaves for the church.   When Joybubbles' mother comes out to the car, she finds that the radio isn't working. They take the car to a shop and find out that it is partially unscrewed and disconnected, as if someone had started to steal it. Joybubbles concludes that the man thought he was a radio thief, but was, in reality, an angel.",

        "description": "In this episode recorded on Christmas Eve, Joybubbles first reminisces on the Christmas Day 11 years earlier on which he first came up with the idea, and name, of Stories and Stuff.   Joybubbles then tells a very recent story, in which he forgot his cane at a grocery store. He called the store, and a friendly manager offered to drive it to his house for free, which is more evidence that \"good things happen around Christmas.\"   Then Joybubbles tells a Christmas story from circa 1957. One Christmas, his Christmas present, a Braille book, came in the mail. Without opening it, Joybubbles read the title of the book right through the wrapping, and his mother chided him for ruining the surprise. The next year, his Christmas present was wrapped in an enormous box. The box had a box in it, and so on, until when he opened the final box, Joybubbles found a book. He couldn't read that one through the wrapping! He and his sister also played with the boxes; the biggest one was big enough for five children.   Joybubbles' next story is about a \"silent conversation\" he had with his friend Dawn. Worn down from her trip to Japan, she called him and they stayed on the line with each other without speaking.   Joybubbles next tells a few stories from his imaginary friend \"Emily-friend,\" who always visits him on Christmas, one about a circus and another about a lonely pinwheel. He looks forward to a fun Christmas, and encourages everyone to ask for an imaginary friend.",

        "description": "First, Joybubbles tells a story that Emily-friend told him on Christmas. In the story, a girl named Deirdre and her impatient father go shopping for a dress. Deirdre knows which one she wants but she gets sent into the dressing room to try on a different one. Emily-friend, seeing this unfold, swaps the two dresses, to the surprise of the grown-ups.   Joybubbles then reads the poem \"The Little Boy and the Old Man\" by Shel Silverstein and the picture book \"Walter the Farting Dog.\"",

        "description": "Joybubbles tells a story about his friend Dawn in Australia going into a jewelry store. She was wearing her beach clothes, so the employees of the store decided that she did not look like someone who would be buying their jewelry, and ignored her. She responded by offering to give them a customer service seminar, which she assumed they wouldn't take her up on. But the manager of the store called her later to take her up on the seminar. Joybubbles then describes the sort of things she teaches, which include \"looking deep\" and \"listening to what's not being said.\" He reads the poem \"The Little Boy and the Old Man\" by Shel Silverstein, which Dawn likes.   Next Joybubbles tells a story about his friend Penelope, whose name he mispronounced as a child. She was pregnant and full of anticipation, but her daughter Mindy was stillborn. She was devastated and told her partner Judy to throw out the birth certificate, among other things. But when Penelope started to regret telling Judy to throw them away, Judy revealed that she had actually kept them, knowing that Penelope would regret getting rid of them.",

        "description": "Joybubbles tells two stories about making a difference: one about someone who made a difference in his life when he was a kid, and another about a time he made a difference in someone's life himself.   The first story is about an ice cream man in his neighborhood when he was a kid. He and his sister loved having ice cream every day, until their dad lost his job and told them he couldn't afford to buy ice cream anymore. But when the ice cream man came to their house, he said he could use some help eating leftover ice cream! This continued every day, with the ice cream man coming to their house to give them his \"leftover ice cream,\" until their dad got a job again. Joybubbles reflects on how thankful he was for the gesture.   The second story takes place when Joybubbles was about 30 years old, and working as a technician at a Denver phone company. His friend Bill, also blind and interested in phones, wanted to work as a technician too, but was having trouble finding a job. Nowhere besides the company that Joybubbles worked seemed to think a blind person could be a technician, and the Denver company said they didn't need two. So Joybubbles did the only thing that could get Bill hired: he quit. Bill did get the job, and worked there for 25 years. Joybubbles, of course, had adventures of his own.",

        "description": "Joybubbles tells a story about his late friend Corey, a terminally ill child. In 1992, when Corey was 6, he was granted a wish by the Make A Wish foundation. His wish was to be Santa Claus. So in April he wore a Santa Claus suit, sang carols with his friends, and passed out gifts at his daycare.   Shortly afterwards, he asked when Halloween was coming. Realizing Corey might not live until October, his mom told him that Halloween was coming in a few days, even though it was only May. Corey and his mom dressed up as pirates and trick-or-treated around his neighborhood. At midnight, for a \"pirate surprise\" he and his Mom went to a closed TV store with universal remotes and turned on all the TVs.   Corey passed away in September 1992.",

She had been adopted out of a children's hospital as a young child.   One day, on the way to a parenting meeting for her adopted mom, Sheralyn had to use the bathroom so they stopped at a gas station. After continuing on almost all the way to the destination, Sheralyn suddenly realized she had left her imaginary friend Bumpo at the gas station. They turned around and drove all the way back, ten or twelve miles, to get Bumpo. Sheralyn called her adopted mom \"mommy\" for the first time, and from then on they celebrated the anniversary of the finding of Bumpo instead of the official adoption date.",

        "description": "Joybubbles tells a story about a television program he liked as a kid: Ding Dong School with Miss Frances. He liked the show so much that he would always wake up like clockwork right at the time when it would be on the air, even more accurately than the clocks in his house. He would talk to Miss Frances about the hard stuff he was going through in his family, and he felt like she was his best friend.   One day to the next, Joybubbles' family moved to New Jersey. They had to throw away a lot of his toys, and they left behind the TV aerial so when they got to New Jersey all they could get was static. At \"Miss Frances time\" Joybubbles tuned in anyway, and then got up on top of the TV and climbed around. He found that if he put his feet in a certain place, he could faintly hear Miss Frances! It was very hot on top of the TV but he stayed there for the entire program, collapsing at the end from dizziness. Joybubbles, not understanding how TV worked at that time, was amazed that Miss Frances had moved with him to New Jersey. When, in the next episode, Miss Frances talked about moving vans, he understood that it was a coded message that she had moved just for him.   Much later, Joybubbles told this story to a man in Atlanta, who sent him a genuine Ding Dong School bell.",
