  First, Joybubbles tells a story that Emily-friend told him on Christmas.
  In the story, a girl named Deirdre and her impatient father go shopping
  for a dress. Deirdre knows which one she wants but she gets sent into
  the dressing room to try on a different one. Emily-friend, seeing this
  unfold, swaps the two dresses, to the surprise of the grown-ups.

  Joybubbles then reads the poem "The Little Boy and the Old Man" by
  Shel Silverstein and the picture book "Walter the Farting Dog."
