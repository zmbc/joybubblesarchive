  Joybubbles tells a story about his friend Dawn in Australia going into a
  jewelry store. She was wearing her beach clothes, so the employees of the
  store decided that she did not look like someone who would be buying their
  jewelry, and ignored her. She responded by offering to give them a customer
  service seminar, which she assumed they wouldn't take her up on. But the manager
  of the store called her later to take her up on the seminar. Joybubbles then
  describes the sort of things she teaches, which include "looking deep" and
  "listening to what's not being said." He reads the poem "The Little
  Boy and the Old Man" by Shel Silverstein, which Dawn likes.

  Next Joybubbles tells a story about his friend Penelope, whose name he
  mispronounced as a child. She was pregnant and full of anticipation, but
  her daughter Mindy was stillborn. She was devastated and told her partner
  Judy to throw out the birth certificate, among other things. But when
  Penelope started to regret telling Judy to throw them away, Judy revealed
  that she had actually kept them, knowing that Penelope would regret getting
  rid of them.
