  Joybubbles tells a story about a television program he liked as a kid: Ding
  Dong School with Miss Frances. He liked the show so much that he would always
  wake up like clockwork right at the time when it would be on the air, even
  more accurately than the clocks in his house. He would talk to Miss Frances about the hard
  stuff he was going through in his family, and he felt like she was his best
  friend.

  One day to the next, Joybubbles' family moved to New Jersey. They had to throw
  away a lot of his toys, and they left behind the TV aerial so when they got to
  New Jersey all they could get was static. At "Miss Frances time" Joybubbles tuned
  in anyway, and then got up on top of the TV and climbed around. He found that
  if he put his feet in a certain place, he could faintly hear Miss Frances! It
  was very hot on top of the TV but he stayed there for the entire program, collapsing
  at the end from dizziness. Joybubbles, not understanding how TV worked at that
  time, was amazed that Miss Frances had moved with him to New Jersey. When, in the
  next episode, Miss Frances talked about moving vans, he understood that it was
  a coded message that she had moved just for him.

  Much later, Joybubbles told this story to a man in Atlanta, who sent him a
  genuine Ding Dong School bell.
