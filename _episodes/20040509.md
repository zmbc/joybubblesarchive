  Joybubbles tells the story of a time that he went to a hotel in his own city
  while living in Memphis, Tennessee. He had always loved swimming pools, so he
  was in the habit of going to hotels just to use the pool all day. One weekend,
  he begins splashing and playing in the pool with a group of children. They
  play in the pool for practically the entire weekend, from the moment the pool
  opens until it closes each day.

  He gets out of the pool on the last day, and he is approached by a woman named
  Ruth. Ruth tells him that she had come to the hotel with the intention of
  committing suicide following the death of her husband. But from her room she
  saw Joybubbles playing with the kids in the pool, and was so moved by it that
  she decided not to go through with the suicide, and choose life instead.
