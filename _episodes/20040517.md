  Joybubbles tells a story from when he was 6 years old and living in Berlin,
  New Jersey. His mother would take him with her to the grocery store, and he
  would wait outside in the car while she took "20 years" to shop. So in order
  to be less bored, he asks God to send Jesus or an angel down for him to
  talk to.

  <br/>
  The very next day, a man comes into the car while Joybubbles is waiting, and
  begins to fiddle with the dashboard. Joybubbles, understanding the fascination
  with the dashboard, waits for a while before asking the man if he is Jesus.
  The man, surprised, says that he isn't, which Joybubbles takes to mean that he
  must be an angel. Joybubbles asks the man all sorts of questions about being an
  angel and living in heaven, before recommending to that the man go to church,
  because the priest there would probably want to meet an angel. Tearfully,
  the man leaves for the church.

  When Joybubbles' mother comes out to the car, she finds that the radio isn't
  working. They take the car to a shop and find out that it is partially unscrewed
  and disconnected, as if someone had started to steal it. Joybubbles concludes
  that the man thought he was a radio thief, but was, in reality, an angel.
